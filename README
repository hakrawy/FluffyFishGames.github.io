+++++++++++ ANOUNCMENT +++++++++++

YouNow just updated their system 2 times.
First update: They removed xp for liking.
Second update: They made liking a channel only give you 5 coins.

These two changes make this bot useless for levelling.
You can still use it to not count as a viewer for streamers you hate.
You can use it to spam YouNow to death.
You can use it to get information about broadcasters they dont share in public.
You can use it to have a much better experience on the site.

Some thoughts about these changes:
Congratulations, YouNow! You officially destroyed your own system and community.
The only way to level without too much effort is now paying for your shitty service or chatting like a monkey.
Aspect ratios of 4:3, resolution of 444p and <500kbps bitrates? SRSLY? 
Your technology is as out of date as your own grandmothers.

We accomplished our goal. We destroyed your system and slowed down the community.
They cant use as much gifts as before, they cant level as fast as before.
Your community will never be the same and will reduce itself to what you really want:
Money

This is the reason why I created this script. To take off your wolfs fur.
Your only goal was to make as much money as possible and I delivered you an excuse to go full into "money-making".

Now you can continue to grab the cash of underages. You filthy bastards.
You are scum and you finally proved it to everyone out there.

Congratulations, YouNow!

And be aware: If you change anything back to how it was before: We'll be back!
